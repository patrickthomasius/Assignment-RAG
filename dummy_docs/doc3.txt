Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed industries from healthcare to finance. Machine learning algorithms can now analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns, make predictions, and even generate creative content. AI assistants, self-driving vehicles, and recommendation systems have become part of daily life, changing how people work, communicate, and interact with technology.

Despite these advancements, AI raises significant ethical and societal concerns. Issues like algorithmic bias, privacy, and the potential displacement of jobs demand careful consideration. Balancing innovation with responsible oversight will determine whether AI becomes a force for widespread benefit or exacerbates existing inequalities.
