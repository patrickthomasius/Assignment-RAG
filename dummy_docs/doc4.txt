Oceans cover over 70% of Earthâ€™s surface and play a vital role in regulating climate and supporting biodiversity. Yet human activities, including overfishing, plastic pollution, and chemical runoff, are putting marine ecosystems under severe stress. Coral reefs, which harbor a quarter of marine species, are particularly vulnerable to warming waters and acidification.

Efforts to protect oceans involve a combination of policy, science, and community engagement. Marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices, and global initiatives to reduce plastic waste are essential steps. By fostering awareness and action, humanity can safeguard ocean health for future generations while maintaining the livelihoods and cultures that depend on them.
