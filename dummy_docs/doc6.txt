Cities have long been centers of human innovation, culture, and economic activity. Urbanization has accelerated in recent decades, with over half of the worldâ€™s population now living in urban areas. This shift brings opportunities, including access to education, healthcare, and jobs, but also challenges like overcrowding, pollution, and strain on infrastructure.

Sustainable urban planning is crucial for the future of cities. Integrating green spaces, efficient public transport, and renewable energy can make urban environments more livable and resilient. As megacities continue to grow, balancing development with environmental and social sustainability will be a defining challenge of the 21st century.
